This is the system for the PLUG library. It's fairly basic right now - it only does basic record keeping of who has a book out. It doesn't keep track of time or anything like that. I'm too lazy to download it right now, but this is released under a GPL v3 license. Technically I'm supposed to include the actual license text, but I'm lazy. I'll get around to it eventually.

Anyway, please feel free to use this code and tell me about issues or enhancements on the issue tracker. I've not really been keeping up with it at all, so...yeah.
